									<h3>COLLABORATIVE DISCUSSION - SUMMARY POST</h3>
									<p>This has been an excellent educational exercise that has guided me into the first steps of data visualisation with R.   
										<br><br>
										As mentioned in my Initial Post, I spent a decent amount of time on getting the data to look the way I wanted it to look. I enjoyed the fact that Feaviour (2023a) independently took a similar approach. 
										<br><br>
										Feaviour (2023b) suggested putting the “no opinion” variable in the centre of the graph - to which I agree that it makes more sense. 
										<br><br>
										Sadly no other students participated in this discussion, however Leigh and I had a little back and forth with tips and reflections for each other. When Feaviour (2023b) asked me how I treated my data to look like it did, I was of course more than happy to share them. In fact, it would have probably made sense to add these into the reflection in my Initial Post. 
										<br><br>
										In addition to the full-data graphic visualisation that both Feaviour and I presented, Feaviour (2023a) also presented the data split up into different themed tables. I think the chosen table graphics would certainly look well in a paper, and it gives space to talk a bit more in depth about each individual theme. 
										<br><br>
										In short, I enjoyed the exercise and I feel like I gained a lot from it - both through figuring out how to present data and make inferences from it as well as from the way Leigh has approached the task. 
										<br><br>
										Word count: 238.
